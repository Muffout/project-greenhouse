## What is Project Greenhouse?
This is a website developed by me using [Blitz.js](https://blitzjs.com/). It utilizes TypeScript and Node.js for the back-end, [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) for the database, and [ChakraUI](https://v2.chakra-ui.com/) for the front-end. 
It simulates an e-commerce type website where the user can sign up, sign in, edit their profile browse other profiles as well as create and edit listings. The idea was to mix an "adoption center" with a webshop for plants, where users can buy plants from other people instead of getting them from shops, thus reducing the amount of houseplants being thrown out.

It is currently still in development.

## Future plans:
- add shopping cart
- simulate payment with credit card
- add "nursery" section: a service similar to pet sitting, but for houseplants, with a rating and comment system
- add language support: ENG/DE
